# SmartLens-NLP
Creating intelligent glasses that can perform various tasks from recognizing different languages, to providing personal assistance for any arduous task. This is implemented using machine learning(NLP) libs provided by
Google Cloud services. Working on both hardware and software components and hope to eventually develop this into an app using SwiftUI. 

(This project was inspired by North's smart glasses and Hacksmith's SMITHI machine)
